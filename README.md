# A List Of Sex Work-Exclusive Tech Companies

In the era of SESTA/FOSTA and other myriad attacks on the rights of sex workers, it’s as important as ever to defend their rights, safety, and the normalization of their careers. This project is an uncomplete list of prominent tech companies (often those lauded as “woke”, etc) that have discriminatory clauses in their TOS or have otherwise excluded sex workers. This is an open-source and growing list, and you can contribute to its development and maintenance on GitHub.

## 🎉 Getting Started

You can follow these steps to get started!

1. 👯‍ Clone the repository locally and cd into the directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:xdesro/sex-work-exclusive-tech-companies.git

cd sex-work-exclusive-tech-companies
```

2. 📦 Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. 🏗 Run the project for local dev. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. 🌌 Build the app for server-side rendered deployment. See more about **Universal SSR** in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#server-rendered-universal-ssr-).

```bash
npm run build

# And to serve that deployment...
npm run start
```

5. ⚡️ Generate a fully pre-rendered static site. See more [in the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-).

```bash
npm run generate
```

> This project was bootstrapped with `create-nuxt-app`. There are more detailed explanations of how everything works in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
