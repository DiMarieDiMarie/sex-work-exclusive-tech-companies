  "intro": "In the era of SESTA/FOSTA and other myriad attacks on the rights of sex workers, it’s as important as ever to defend their rights, safety, and the normalization of their careers. The following is an uncomplete list of prominent tech companies (often those lauded as “woke”, etc) that have discriminatory clauses in their TOS or have otherwise excluded sex workers. This is an open-source and growing list, and you can contribute to its development and maintenance on GitHub. ",

      "content": "We all rely on online communities to work, socialize, and learn. From the largest social media sites to the smallest message board, online platforms are central to our right to assemble and speak out. SESTA/FOSTA puts ordinary people at risk of being shut out of those spaces.\n\nThe authors of SESTA/FOSTA claim that they designed the law to fight sex trafficking, but the law doesn’t punish traffickers. It does threaten legitimate online speech. Since Congress passed SESTA/FOSTA, owners of popular online platforms have responded by censoring completely lawful activity from their sites. Other sites hosting lawful activity have shut down entirely."
