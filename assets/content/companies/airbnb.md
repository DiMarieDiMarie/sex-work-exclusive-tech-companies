From xbiz.com:

> Worldwide lodging app Airbnb now owns an AI technology that allows them to discriminate against people in certain categories, specifically including sex workers, based on unrelated social media posts and other online data.
>
> The name of the technology on its patent is “Determining Trustworthiness and Compatibility of a Person” and it stigmatizes sex work and “involvement in pornography” by grouping them with drug use, membership in hate groups, “neuroticism” and “narcissism, Machiavellism and psychopathy.”
